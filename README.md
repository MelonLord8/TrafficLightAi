# TrafficLightAi
A project meant to use evolutionary concepts in order to create more efficient traffic light systems.

It will be used to create and train a neural network that would input variables describing the state of the road, such as the number of cars on one side, the flow rate of cars, the previous directions, etc.

This project utilises PyTorch and NumPy.
